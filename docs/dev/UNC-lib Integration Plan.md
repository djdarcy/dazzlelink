# UNC-lib Integration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the approach for integrating the UNC-lib package with Dazzlelink to improve network path handling, particularly for UNC paths and network drives.

## Current State

Dazzlelink currently uses a custom `UNCAdapter` class in `path.py` that handles conversion between UNC paths and drive letters. While functional, this implementation has limitations:

- Relies on parsing the output of Windows-specific commands
- Limited validation of path correctness
- No specialized handling for security zones or network connectivity issues
- Lacks comprehensive cross-platform abstractions

## UNC-lib Capabilities

The UNC-lib package provides:

- Robust path conversion between UNC and local formats
- Path validation and type detection
- Windows-specific enhancements for network drives and security zones
- Cross-platform abstractions where possible
- Specialized logging and error handling for network operations

## Integration Approach

### Phase 1: Core Path Conversion (Current)

1. Replace `UNCAdapter` methods with UNC-lib's converter functions:
   - Replace `unc_to_drive` with `convert_to_local`
   - Replace `drive_to_unc` with `convert_to_unc`
   - Replace `normalize_path` with UNC-lib's version

2. Update imports and dependencies:
   - Add UNC-lib as a dependency in setup.py/pyproject.toml
   - Update imports in path.py and other relevant modules

3. Add compatibility layer:
   - Create adapter functions to maintain backward compatibility
   - Ensure existing dazzlelink files continue to work

### Phase 2: Enhanced Path Validation and Detection

1. Integrate path validation:
   - Use `validate_path`, `validate_unc_path`, and `validate_local_path` from UNC-lib
   - Add validation to prevent invalid path handling

2. Improve path type detection:
   - Use `is_unc_path`, `is_network_drive`, etc. for better type detection
   - Enhance error messages with more specific information

3. Update path handling throughout the codebase:
   - Review and update all path handling code to use UNC-lib functions
   - Ensure consistent handling across the codebase

### Phase 3: Windows-Specific Enhancements

1. Integrate security zone handling:
   - Add support for `fix_security_zone` and `add_to_intranet_zone`
   - Enhance Windows user experience with better security handling

2. Add network drive management:
   - Integrate `create_network_mapping` and other network functions
   - Provide utilities for managing network connections

3. Implement additional Windows-specific features:
   - Security and permissions handling
   - Registry integration where relevant

### Phase 4: Full Integration and Optimization

1. Remove redundant code:
   - Eliminate any remaining custom path handling in favor of UNC-lib
   - Clean up compatibility layers where no longer needed

2. Optimize performance:
   - Take advantage of UNC-lib's caching and optimization features
   - Benchmark and improve path handling operations

3. Add new capabilities:
   - Expose additional UNC-lib features through Dazzlelink's API
   - Enhance documentation to cover new capabilities

## Compatibility Considerations

- Ensure backward compatibility with existing .dazzlelink files
- Maintain consistent behavior during the transition
- Add versioning to .dazzlelink format to handle evolving capabilities
- Document any behavior changes for users

## Testing Strategy

- Create test cases for UNC path conversion
- Test with various network configurations
- Verify backward compatibility with existing .dazzlelink files
- Create integration tests that verify end-to-end functionality

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Current release (v0.6.0)
- Phase 2: Next minor release (v0.6.x)
- Phase 3: Following minor release (v0.6.y)
- Phase 4: Next major release (v0.7.0)
